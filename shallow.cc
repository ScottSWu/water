 * # Shallow water equations
 * 
 * ## Physics picture
 * 
 * The shallow water equations are a two-dimensional PDE system
 * that describes water waves that are very long compared to the
 * water depth.  It applies even in situations that you might not
 * think of as "shallow"; for example, tsunami waves are long enough
 * that they can be modeled using the shallow water equations even
 * when traveling over mile-deep parts of oceans.
 * 
 * The shallow water equations treat water as incompressible and
 * inviscid, and assume that the horizontal velocity remains constant
 * in any vertical column of water.  The unknowns at each point are
 * the water height and the total horizontal momentum in a water
 * column; the equations describe conservation of mass (fluid is
 * neither created nor destroyed) and conservation of linear momentum.
 * We will solve these equations with a numerical method that also
 * exactly conserves mass and momentum (up to rounding error), though
 * it only approximately conserves energy.
 * 
 * I was inspired to use this system for our assignment by reading the
 * chapter on [shallow water simulation in MATLAB][exm] from Cleve
 * Moler's books on "Experiments in MATLAB"; there is also a very readable
 * [Wikipedia article][wiki] on the shallow water equations.
 * The basic variables are water height ($h$), and the velocity components
 * ($u, v$).  We write the governing equations in the form
 * $$
 *   U_t = F(U)_x + G(U)_y
 * $$
 * where
 * $$
 *   U = \begin{bmatrix} h \\ hu \\ hv \end{bmatrix},
 *   F = \begin{bmatrix} hu \\ h^2 u + gh^2/2 \\ huv \end{bmatrix}
 *   G = \begin{bmatrix} hv \\ huv \\ h^2 v + gh^2/2 \end{bmatrix}
 * $$
 * The functions $F$ and $G$ are called *fluxes*, and describe how the
 * conserved quantities (volume and momentum) enter and exit a region
 * of space.
 * 
 * Note that we also need a bound on the characteristic wave speeds
 * for the problem in order to ensure that our method doesn't explode;
 * we use this to control the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) number
 * relating wave speeds, time steps, and space steps.  For the shallow
 * water equations, the characteristic wave speed is $\sqrt{g h}$
 * where $g$ is the gravitational constant and $h$ is the height of the
 * water; in addition, we have to take into account the velocity of
 * the underlying flow.

 * 
 * ## Implementation
 * 
 * Our solver takes advantage of C++ templates to get (potentially)
 * good performance while keeping a clean abstraction between the
 * solver code and the details of the physics.  The `Shallow2D`
 * class specifies the precision of the comptutation (single precision),
 * the data type used to represent vectors of unknowns and fluxes
 * (the C++ `std::array`).  We are really only using the class as 
 * name space; we never create an instance of type `Shallow2D`,
 * and the `flux` and `wave_speed` functions needed by the solver are
 * declared as static (and inline, in the hopes of getting the compiler
 * to optimize for us).

/**
 * # MinMod limiter
 * 
 * Numerical methods for solving nonlinear wave equations are
 * complicated by the fact that even with smooth initial data, a
 * nonlinear wave can develop discontinuities (shocks) in finite time.
 * 
 * This makes for interesting analysis, since a "strong" solution
 * that satisfies the differential equation no longer makes sense at
 * a shock -- instead, we have to come up with some mathematically
 * and physically reasonable definition of a "weak" solution that
 * satisfies the PDE away from the shock and satisfies some other
 * condition (an entropy condition) at the shock.
 * 
 * The presence of shocks also makes for interesting *numerical*
 * analysis, because we need to be careful about employing numerical
 * differentiation formulas that sample a discontinuous function at
 * points on different sides of a shock.  Using such formulas naively
 * usually causes the numerical method to become unstable.  A better
 * method -- better even in the absence of shocks! -- is to consider
 * multiple numerical differentiation formulas and use the highest
 * order one that "looks reasonable" in the sense that it doesn't
 * predict wildly larger slopes than the others.  Because these
 * combined formulas *limit* the wild behavior of derivative estimates
 * across a shock, we call them *limiters*.  With an appropriate limiter,
 * we can construct methods that have high-order accuracy away from shocks
 * and are at least first-order accurate close to a shock.  These are
 * sometimes called *high-resolution* methods.
 * 
 * The MinMod (minimum modulus) limiter is one example of a limiter.
 * The MinMod limiter estimates the slope through points $f_-, f_0, f_+$
 * (with the step $h$ scaled to 1) by
 * $$
 *   f' = \operatorname{minmod}((f_+-f_-)/2, \theta(f_+-f_0), \theta(f_0-f_-))
 * $$
 * where the minmod function returns the argument with smallest absolute
 * value if all arguments have the same sign, and zero otherwise.
 * Common choices of $\theta$ are $\theta = 1.0$ and $\theta = 2.0$.
 * 
 * The minmod limiter *looks* like it should be expensive to computer,
 * since superficially it seems to require a number of branches.
 * We do something a little tricky, getting rid of the condition
 * on the sign of the arguments using the `copysign` instruction.
 * If the compiler does the "right" thing with `max` and `min`
 * for floating point arguments (translating them to branch-free
 * intrinsic operations), this implementation should be relatively fast.
 * 
 * There are many other potential choices of limiters as well.  We'll
 * stick with this one for the code, but you should feel free to
 * experiment with others if you know what you're doing and think it
 * will improve performance or accuracy.

/**
 * # Jiang-Tadmor central difference scheme
 * 
 * [Jiang and Tadmor][jt] proposed a high-resolution finite difference
 * scheme for solving hyperbolic PDE systems in two space dimensions.
 * The method is particularly attractive because, unlike many other
 * methods in this space, it does not require that we write any
 * solvers for problems with special initial data (so-called Riemann
 * problems), nor even that we compute Jacobians of the flux
 * functions.
 * 
 * The Jiang-Tadmor scheme works by alternating between a main grid
 * and a staggered grid offset by half a step in each direction.
 * We currently manage this implicitly: the arrays at even time steps
 * represent cell values on the main grid, and arrays at odd steps
 * represent cell values on the staggered grid.  Our main `run` 
 * function always takes an even number of time steps to ensure we end
 * up on the primary grid.
 * 
 * While this code is based loosely on the Fortran code at the end of
 * Jiang and Tadmor's paper, we've written the current code to be
 * physics-agnostic (rather than hardwiring it to the shallow water
 * equations -- or the Euler equations in the Jiang-Tadmor paper).
 * If you're interested in the Euler equations, feel free to add your
 * own physics class to support them!
 * 
 * [jt]: http://www.cscamm.umd.edu/tadmor/pub/central-schemes/Jiang-Tadmor.SISSC-98.pdf
 * 
 * ## Interface
 * 
 * We want a clean separation between the physics, the solver,
 * and the auxiliary limiter methods used by the solver.  At the same
 * time, we don't want to pay the overhead (mostly in terms of lost
 * optimization opportunities) for calling across an abstraction
 * barrier in the inner loops of our solver.  We can get around this
 * in C++ by providing the solver with *template arguments*, resolved
 * at compile time, that describe separate classes to implement the
 * physics and the limiter.
 *
 * The `Central2D` solver class takes two template arguments:
 * `Physics` and `Limiter`.  For `Physics`, we expect the name of a class
 * that defines:
 * 
 *  - A type for numerical data (`real`)
 *  - A type for solution and flux vectors in each cell (`vec`)
 *  - A flux computation function (`flux(vec& F, vec& G, const vec& U)`)
 *  - A wave speed computation function 
 *    (`wave_speed(real& cx, real& cy, const vec& U)`).
 * 
 * The `Limiter` argument is a type with a static function `limdiff`
 * with the signature
 * 
 *         limdiff(fm, f0, fp)
 * 
 * The semantics are that `fm`, `f0`, and `fp` are three successive
 * grid points in some direction, and the function returns an approximate
 * (scaled) derivative value from these points.
 * 
 * The solver keeps arrays for the solution, flux values, derivatives
 * of the solution and the fluxes, and the solution at the next time
 * point.  We use the C++ `vector` class to manage storage for these
 * arrays; but since we want to think of them as 2D arrays, we also
 * provide convenience functions to access them with multiple indices
 * (though we maintain C-style 0-based indexing).  The internal arrays
 * are padded with ghost cells; the ghost cell in the lower left corner
 * of the domain has index (0,0).

 * we might want to advance for a period of time, write out a picture,
 * advance more, and write another picture.  In this sense, `tfinal`
 * should be interpreted as an offset from the time represented by
 * the simulator at the start of the call, rather than as an absolute time.
 * 
 * We always take an even number of steps so that the solution
 * at the end lives on the main grid instead of the staggered grid.
